A mobile Gitter client using isomorphic React.

## WIP

I'm building this as an exercise to learn some React. Feel free to contribute tho :+1:

## Getting Started

You'll need to create an app at https://developer.gitter.im and expose your credentials through env vars:

- `export OAUTH_KEY=<your_app_key>`
- `export OAUTH_SECRET=<your_app_secret>`

- Start the server: `npm start`
- Build the app+css: `npm run webpack`
